# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. 
This project involves analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments to gain insights into public opinion on various topics discussed on Twitter.

# Features
**Twitter Data Collection:** Utilize the Twitter API or pre-collected datasets to gather tweets relevant to the analysis.
**Text Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data to remove noise, tokenize words, and handle other preprocessing tasks.
**Sentiment Analysis Model:** Develop a machine learning or deep learning model to classify tweet sentiments.

# Usage
To use the sentiment analysis system:

*Data Collection:* Gather tweets using the Twitter API or use pre-collected datasets.
*Preprocessing:* Clean and preprocess the tweet text data to prepare it for analysis.
*Model Training:* Train a sentiment analysis model using machine learning or deep learning techniques.
*Prediction:* Apply the trained model to classify sentiments of new tweets.

# Technologies Used
Python
Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
Machine Learning or Deep Learning frameworks (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)

# Data Sources
Twitter Data: Kaggle

# Future Enhancements
Visualising the sentiment distribution and trends using plots such as histograms, pie charts, or time series graphs
Deploying the sentiment analysis model as a web application or API for real-time sentiment analysis of tweets.
Improve model accuracy and performance through fine-tuning and experimentation.
Expand analysis to include sentiment analysis of other social media platforms.
Incorporate topic modeling to identify key themes in the tweets.
